# Mini Project 2: Using Tensorflow

To run this project, please download or clone the script neuralnet.py and run ```python neuralnet.py```.

It will automatically download the dataset and run Tensorflow.
The dataset that this script uses is a subset of fashion_mnist, configured for two-class classification.

For the display of testing, the script chooses 30 random images from the prediction set and displays the data and the verification results. Here are two examples of the output of this script.

This example had a test accuracy of 93.65%.
